# Geometrical Objects Coding Exercise

## **Description**
The purpose of this exercise was to explore the concept of translating abstract ideas into code. Classes and objects in JavaScript were used to represent 2D-shapes. The testing framework 'Jest' was used to test the basic functionality / behavior of such classes.
